# Full-Stack Portfolio Project 

## Brief App Description
## App Name: CodeCareer  
This Software Engineering Job Board is a specialized web application designed by me (Marangely - an inspired junior software engineering student currently on the road to becoming an above exceptional FSW Developer!) for software engineers and employers in the software development industry. The app serves as a platform for employers to post job listings tailored to software engineering roles, including job titles, descriptions, requirements, and locations. Software engineers can search for relevant job opportunities based on roles or positions they have most experience level in or even a preferred/position of choice. The app provides user authentication for both employers and job seekers, allowing employers to manage their company information and job listings while enabling job seekers to update their skills and track their applications. With email notifications and seamless communication features, this Software Engineering Job Board simplifies the job search process for software engineers and facilitates efficient hiring for employers in the software engineering field.

This is a web application built with PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and REST API that allows users to add their favorite sneakers to a list.

## Installation

To run this app on your local machine, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm install axios react-router-dom
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
